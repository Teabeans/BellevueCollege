Class Level Block header {

Main Method Level Block header {
Line of instruction goes here;
Next line of instruction goes here;
If (line of instruction is itself a block) {
Then indent the contents of the block over one more;
Just like this;
And this;
But be sure to ‘outdent’ at the block close;
} // Like this
Instructions after that block go here;
Until you’re ready to close the main method level;
Then you outdent again;
} // Like this, to close the main method.

Leave a gap to your next method {
And indent the new method’s code lines appropriately;
Like so;
}

So here’s the hard part {
How many indentation levels {
Are there? {
And can you keep them {
Neat and orderly? {
}
Even if they {
}
}
}
Don’t follow a nice {
}
}
Pattern? {
}
}

} // Don’t forget to close your class!
